        <h3>What is a Guitar?</h3>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

        <p class="lead">The guitar is a string instrument which is played by plucking the strings. The main parts of a guitar are the body, the fretboard, the headstock and the strings. Guitars are usually made from wood or plastic. Their strings are made of steel or nylon.</p>
        <p class="lead">The guitar strings are plucked with the fingers and fingernails of the right hand (or left hand, for left handed players), or a small pick made of thin plastic. This type of pick is called a "plectrum" or guitar pick. The left hand holds the neck of the guitar while the fingers pluck the strings. Different finger positions on the fretboard make different notes.</p>
        <p class="lead">Guitar-like plucked string instruments have been used for many years. In many countries and at many different time periods, guitars and other plucked string instruments have been very popular, because they are light to carry from place to place, they are easier to learn to play than many other instruments. Guitars are used for many types of music, from Classical to Rock. Most pieces of popular music that have been written since the 1950s are written with guitars.</p>
        <p class="lead">There are many different types of guitars, classified on how they are made and the type of music they are used for. All traditional types of guitar have a body which is hollow. This makes the sound of the strings louder, and gives the guitar its quality. This type of guitar is called "acoustic". (An acoustic instrument is one that makes its own dynamics.)</p>
        <p class="lead">From the 1930s, people started making and playing guitars that used electricity and amplifiers to control the loudness. These guitars, which are often used in popular music, are called electric guitars. They do not need to have a hollow body. This is because they do not use acoustics to amplify the sound.</p>
        <p class="lead">Most guitars have six strings, but there are also guitars with four, seven, eight, ten, or twelve strings. More strings make the instrument sound fuller. The neck of a guitar has bars or marks called frets. Frets help a guitarist know where to put his or her fingers to get the right pitch when playing. Standard tuning defines the string pitches as E, A, D, G, B, and E, from lowest (low E2) to highest (high E4). Standard tuning is used by most guitarists, and frequently used tunings can be understood as variations on standard tuning.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="lead">There have been instruments like the guitar for at least 5,000 years. The guitar may have come from older instruments known as the sitara from ancient India and central Asia. The oldest known picture of a guitar-like instrument is a 3300 year old stone carving of a Hittite bard. The oldest guitar-like instrument that is still complete is the "Warwick Gittern" in the British Museum. It belonged to Elizabeth I of England and probably to her father Henry VIII before it was given to her. It is about 500 years old.
        <p class="lead">The design of the modern guitar began with the Roman cithara. The cithara was brought by the Romans to Hispania (Spain) around 40 AD. In the 8th century the Moors brought the four-stringed oud into Spain. The introduction to the oud caused changes to the design of the cithara. In other parts of Europe, the six-string Scandinavian lut (lute) became popular wherever the Vikings had been. By 1200 AD, there were two types of the four string "guitar": the guitarra morisca (Moorish guitar) from Spain which had a rounded back, wide fingerboard and several soundholes, and the guitarra latina (Latin guitar) which was more like the modern guitar with one sound hole and a narrower neck.</p>
        <p class="lead">The Spanish vihuela, of the 16th century, was another instrument similar to the guitar. It had lute-style tuning and a body that was like a guitar. The vihuela was only popular for a short amount of time. It is not known whether it was simply a design that combined features of the oud and lute or a transition from the Renaissance instrument to the modern guitar.</p> 
        <p class="lead">The Vinaccia family from Naples, Italy were famous mandolin makers. It is thought that they also made the oldest six-string guitar that still exists. There is a guitar built that was signed and dated 1779 on the label by Gaetano Vinaccia (1759 - after 1831) Although there are many fakes that have dates on them from that time, this guitar is believed by experts to be genuine (real).</p> 
        <p class="lead">The guitar's design was improved (made better) by the famous Spanish luthier, Antonio Torres Jurado (1817-1892) and by Louis Panormo of London.</p>
        <p class="lead">The electric guitar was made by George Beauchamp in 1936. Beauchamp co-founded a company called Rickenbacher to make guitars. However, Danelectro was the first to produce electric guitars for the public to use.</p>

                    <p>When most people think of a guitar, it’s most likely an electric guitar that comes to mind.
                        The electric guitar was invented during the 1930s and 40s and since then different companies have developed many diverse models and shapes have appeared.
                        Some of the most well-known models are the Fender Stratocaster, the Gibson Les Paul, and the Fender Telecaster.Unlike acoustic guitars, electric guitars are not hollow which means the instrument cannot resonate and project sound. In order to be heard, electric guitars have magnetic pickups on the body of the guitar underneath the strings.
                        The pickups convert string vibrations into an electrical signal which is then sent to an amplifier (amp) which increases and projects the sound.
                        Electric guitars strings are often plucked with a pick, although some players choose to use their fingers.
                        Because of their wide variety, electric guitars are usually what most people begin playing on.
                        They are available in smaller sizes, such as ¾ size, which work well for young children.
                        Many players also use effects pedals when playing on electric guitar.
                        The huge range of effects pedals available can add delay, distortion, reverberation, or any effect one can imagine. Electric guitars changed the sound of pop music and introduced new genres such as rock and roll and metal.
                        However, they are also used in jazz, blues, and other styles of music, as are acoustic guitars, which are discussed next.</p>

                    </div>
                  <p>Another popular guitar style is the acoustic guitar.
                    Like the electric guitar, acoustic guitars use steel strings and have the same general shape of a neck attached to a body.
                    Unlike many electric guitars, acoustic guitars are hollow and therefore wider.
                    The space inside the guitar is called the sound box.
                    This allows the body of the guitar, particularly the top part called the soundboard, to vibrate and create resonance to greatly increase the volume of plucked strings. Although acoustic guitars are loud on their own, they can also be outfitted with pickups and plugged into an amplifier to increase the sound.
                    They will still retain their acoustic sound which is a bit brighter and more resonant than electric guitars.
                    Acoustic guitars come in different sizes and some have a cutaway which allows the player to reach higher notes on the fretboard.
                    Although there is not as much variety as electric guitars, acoustic guitars still come in different models and sizes.
                    This is the perfect instrument to bring to a beach bonfire!</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>As the name implies, semi-acoustic guitars, also called hollow-body electric guitars, occupy a middle ground between the electric and acoustic guitars previously discussed.
                      Semi-acoustic guitars have a sound box but they are not as wide or large as acoustic guitars.
                      They always have at least one pickup and they usually look more like electric guitars with f-holes on the front of the body.
                      During the 1930s, semi-acoustic guitars were used widely in jazz bands. 
                      The smooth sound, which is a bit less piercing than acoustic guitars, fit well into jazz ensembles and the portable guitar could be used to play chords when a piano was not available. As construction improved and new models emerged they began to be used in folk, pop, blues, and other musical styles.
                      A special type of semi-acoustic guitar is called an archtop guitar.
                      They are called that because, unlike other types of guitars, the top and back of the guitar are arched, not flat.
                      Sometimes bass guitars (which we’ll look at shortly) can even be arched.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Unlike the usual guitar, which has six strings, 12-string guitars are called so because they have twelve strings.
                        12-string guitars double each guitar string which results in more resonance and a big, luscious sound perfect for playing chords in a rhythm section.  
                        Typically, strings an octave higher are added to the four lowest strings and strings in unison are added to the two highest strings.
                        A set of doubled strings is called a course.
                        Other than the extra strings, 12-string guitars are very similar to 6-string guitars, although there are some minor differences such as a wider fretboard in order to accommodate the playing of the extra strings and a longer headstock to hold the extra tuning pegs.
                        While these guitars are perfect for chords and rhythm playing, the doubled strings make solo playing or fast single notes quite hard. You can find electric as well as acoustic 12-string guitars and they are frequently used in rock, pop, and folk music by guitarists such as Jimmy Page and John McLaughlin.</p>

                    <p>Classical guitars, also called Spanish guitars or nylon string guitars, are similar to acoustic guitars but with one crucial difference: the strings are made of nylon rather than steel.
                        These guitars are used primarily to play classical or flamenco music but they have been incorporated into other musical styles, especially jazz and bossa nova, as well.
                        The wide string spacing and the soft nylon strings lends this type of guitar to finger-styles playing instead of using a pick. Because of the string material, construction, and playing style, these guitars have a darker and richer sound than their steel-string relatives.
                        While this is great for solo playing, it can make classical guitars hard to hear in a band setting.
                        Fortunately, just like acoustic guitars, they can be amplified with the addition of a pickup!</p>

                    <p>Like electric and acoustic guitars, bass guitars are plucked with fingers or a pick and are tuned similarly.
                        However, there are some key differences: most importantly, bass guitars sound an octave lower than non-bass guitars and they usually only have four strings. 
                        Because of the lower sound, the strings of bass guitars are much larger and they have longer necks and scale length. Bass guitars are generally electric instruments but it’s not too hard to find an acoustic bass guitar if you look.
                        It’s also possible to find bass guitars with five or even six strings! 
                        Bass guitars are used in rhythm sections in a wide variety of musical styles but they can also be used as lead instruments.

This was done in order to make the instrument louder, that is, more resonant, so they could be heard over other instruments.
                        Other than the increased volume, resonator guitars have a specific tone and are used frequently in bluegrass music. 
                        Oftentimes, resonator guitars are played with a steel – see the next section to learn more about what that is!</p>

                    <p>Besides resonator guitars, the two main types of steel guitars are the lap steel and the pedal steel guitars.
                        However, any type of guitar played with a steel bar, or any other hard object, such as a bottleneck, can be considered a steel guitar.  
                        The steel bar, just called a “steel,” is used in place of the fretting-hand fingers and frets to determine which notes to play. The steel slides along the strings and can be used to slide continuously from one note to the next.
                        Lap steel guitars are held on the player’s lap while pedal steel guitars sit on a metal frame in front of the player.
                        These guitars are used frequently in country music, honky-tonk, and blues.
                        Here, the famous song “Ghost Riders in the Sky” is played on a pedal steel guitar.</p>

                  <p>Ukuleles are small instruments with four nylon strings and they come in four main sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone but there are lots of other types of ukulele too.</p>
                  <p>They are often used by singer-songwriters to accompany their singing and are often used by children to learn on as there are lots of easy songs for beginners to learn.</p>

                  <p>The mandolin is a small instrument with four doubled courses (sets of strings).</p>
                  <p>It originated in Italy and is played with a pick.</p>
                  <p>Because they are so small, the distances between frets are much smaller than on a guitar.</p>
                  <p>Mandolins are used extensively in folk, bluegrass, and country music but they aren’t uncommon in other musical settings as well.</p>
